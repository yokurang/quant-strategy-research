# Strategy Research

## Introduction

This README serves as an overview for the analysis and exploration of a market making strategy implemented for ETH/USDC on Binance. The provided data consists of market data (`market_data.parq`) and fills data (`fills_data.parq`), generated by the strategy. The primary goal of this strategy is to provide liquidity while minimizing positional risk, without the ability to go short, by market making around a target inventory.

The primary questions I want to answer are:

1. What is the Profit and Loss (PnL) for the strategy?
2. How can the PnL be broken down into different buckets to provide more detailed insights?
3. Are there any notable patterns or behaviors in the strategy's execution?
4. Following a fill, what tends to happen to the prices?

The analysis is conducted using Python and pandas within a Jupyter notebook, focusing on various aspects of the strategy's performance divided into four main sections. Here, the second section is dedicated to answer the first two questions, the third section is dedicated to answer the third question, and the fourth section is dedicated to answer the fourth question. This document outlines the structure of the notebook and the approach taken to understand and evaluate the strategy's effectiveness.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook `main.ipynb` is organized into several sections, each addressing different facets of the strategy's performance and market impact. Here's what each section aims to cover:

### 1. Data Exploration

Here, I try to gain an initial understanding of the provided datasets (`fills_data.parq` and `market_data.parq`). This involves loading the datasets, summarizing their statistics, and visualizing key aspects.

### 2. Investigating the PnL

Here, I calculate and analyze the Profit and Loss (PnL) of the strategy. In this section, I calculated the total PnL and explained the steps involved in my calculation, broke down the PnL into various components or buckets for a more granular analysis, and employed multi-linear regression to identify and rank factors significantly affecting PnL.

### 3. Strategy Behaviour

Here, I explored the strategy's trading patterns and behaviors. I did this by investigating through data visualization and classification models to identify any consistent trading patterns or behaviors.

### 4. Deeper Dive on Market Impact

Finally, I examined the impact of the trading strategy on market prices, especially following order fills. Here, I analyzed price movements post-fills and assessing the correlation between trading activity and price changes.

## Setup Instructions

To work with the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.9. `python3.9 -m venv .venv`
2. Source the virtual environment by running `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac)
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Ensure the data files (`fills_data.parq` and `market_data.parq`) are located in the `data` folder.
